## ☀️ Hi! I'm Sergey Svistunov. 

👔 I work in IT Presales. I started as a Sysadmin, then worked as a Project manager, Business Analyst, and continued as a Presale - POS terminals, payment software and related services. I've been researching, building and selling IT solutions all my life!
<br>
<br>
💻 After years of working in many very different companies and environments, around 2020 I decided to slide to more technical side, I began my journey towards a software developer role. I started with CodeWars achieving 3kyu level in **C++** and **Kotlin**: <img src="https://www.codewars.com/users/SergeyFM/badges/large?theme=light"> <br> And now I'm applying this knowledge to the projects you'll find here on GitHub.
<br><br>
There are several projects that I've done. Here are public ones on GitHub:
* Console application that imports word definition from LingQ portal
* Original solutions to typical coding riddles in Kotlin

The world of programming isn't uncharted territory for me because I’ve been in and out of coding since my student days. Learning to code is hard, so I don’t get discouraged when I make mistakes at first. I’m diligently acquiring the Kotlin programming language with a focus on Android and backend development. <br>
## I write code every day!

💥 I’m very excited about turning my hobby into a job. My only regret is that I didn’t do it sooner! <br>
I’m happy to be part of the #GitHub community and have the chance to share my ideas and learn from you all! <br> <br>

🏃 Besides programming, my hobbies include marathon running, photography and learning human languages - so far I can speak English, German and my native language Russian.
